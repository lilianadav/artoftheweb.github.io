        "The Mail Art and The Big Monster" by Ulises Carrión explores the concept of Mail Art and how we can view it from different perspectives.
        He specifically touches on the idea that Mail Art is restricted by our need to abide by certain rules and pay postage fees if we wish to mail our art piece — 
        symbolizing the obstacles imposed by authorities on our freedom of expression.
        Although I am unsure of what Carrión means by the ‘Big Monster’ (and he expresses that he does not know either) I believe he is suggesting that there are forces oppressing our ability to freely practice art and we must resist these forces by metaphorically 'knocking on the Monster’s door,' signifying our efforts to break down barriers hindering unrestricted creativity.

        Laurel Schwulst’s essay, “My website is a shifting house next to a river of knowledge. What could yours be?”, describes websites from an artist’s perspective, moving away from the idea of websites as simply a “bundle of files living on a server somewhere.” She suggests that websites should not be run by private companies that prioritize advertising, but instead be spaces that put the user’s experience first and showcase the artist’s creativity. Schwulst introduces the idea of websites as different worlds, highlighting the endless possibilities of what a website can be — from a shelf to a rock that is falling into the deep ocean. This perspective of websites is one I had not considered before, as I often don’t think of the artists creating the websites, nor do I often visit websites that I would consider “art” (they are often commercialized websites). However, I enjoyed reading the different metaphors Schwulst uses for websites, and I’m excited to see how those manifest themselves throughout this course.

        In this week’s reading, Lialina discusses the significance of Geocities in the early days of the internet.  She addresses the disappearance of Geocities and its consequences on the users of the web. For instance, the destruction of Geocities has caused a lot of malfunctioning pages, dead links, and broken images. Lialina calls these pages ‘ruins’ and suggests that they represent the times when “eternal construction was the core of all online activity.” She concludes the essay by suggesting that looking back at Geocities “provides us with the experience of getting old” and insight into how the web has transformed over the last 20 years.

        “Alt-Text as Poetry Workbook” serves to introduce its readers to the concept of alt-text and its significance for people with visual disabilities.  Coklyat & Finnegan describe alt-text as “a written description of an image posted online” and explain that it is an “essential part of web accessibility”, as it allows individuals with impaired vision to access images that are posted online. They suggest looking at alt-text as a form of poetry, highlighting key three ideas from the world of poetry that are applicable to writing alt-text: attention to language, word economy, and experimental spirit. Before reading this workbook, I had never encountered the concept of alt-text, which surprised me given its importance. Specifically, I found it surprising to learn now that a lack of proper alt-text (or alt-text in general) restricts an entire group of individuals from accessing certain images. Now that I am aware of alt-text and its importance, I am eager to learn more about how to use it effectively and to always bear it in mind when creating web content that includes images.

        “A Personal Computer for Children of All Cultures” introduces the One Laptop Per Child project's mission to empower underprivileged children by improving their education through access to laptops. Nasser highlights the historical context of computers as educational tools, and addresses challenges in programming languages that reveal hidden linguistic biases, particularly in non-English based languages like Arabic. Moreover, the text touches on the subjective nature of computer data representation and the importance of cultural diversity in technology production to avoid errors and misrepresentations.

        "New Modernism(s)" by Ben Duvall explores the connections between typography, image, and surface in graphic design. Duvall introduces the equation "surface + sign = a work of graphic design" to define this relationship, emphasizing its importance for both students and practitioners of graphic design. Throughout the text, Duvall discusses how the function of surface and signs differs in modernism and postmodernism. He suggests that modernism focused on the standardization of sign systems, using rigorous regimentation and reduction to pure form. In contrast, postmodernism emphasized the fragmentation of sign systems, highlighting vernacular and ambiguous typography. The reading concludes with the idea of hypermodernism, which Duvall defines as the changes seen in post-digital art and design, where signs and symbols are standardized.

        "Beyond the New Media Frame: The Poetics of Absence in Vera Frenkel's String Games," explores the artistic evolution of Vera Frenkel, emphasizing her use of new media and technology to explore historical events. Tuer breaks down Frenkel's innovative approach, showing how she uses new media and prototype tech to bring past events and memories, especially those of displacement and exile, to light. The text also provides examples of two of Frenkel's pieces: "String Games" and "Body Missing". "String Games" is described as a pioneering work in new media art, featuring a video performance combined with large lithographs and drawings. It involves the use of technology to explore memory and the transmission of images in the electronic age. "Body Missing" is an installation and website that tells stories of stolen artworks and archival evidence, touching on the theme of mourning and alluding to the collective trauma of the Holocaust.

        “Performing the Feed" by Paul Soulellis,  explores the concept of making public in the digital era, focusing on experimental publishing and artistic practices. He suggests that “making public” is becoming a new paradigm, a “new array of gestures and performative conditions” that need to be theorized and examined. Soulellis explains how the act of posting has shifted from a traditional, physical format to the way we experience posting today, which has become an essential  method of sharing information in the digital world. Moreover, the text touches on the idea of publishing as less about 'breaking' news and more about 'layering' information in a fluid manner, creating a seamless flow of data without clear boundaries. Soulellis concludes the text by calling for a collaborative effort involving artists, archivists, and activists to challenge the smooth flow of information and find alternative ways of seeing and understanding feeds. He explains that doing so will allow us to prepare for the uncertainties in the digital information landscape.

    <h3>Discussion questions:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li> What strategies can we use to disrupt the smooth flow of information in digital feeds and encourage critical thinking with the content we see in the digital world? </li>
        <li> How can individuals train themselves to discern between the real information and fake information they see on their feeds?   </li>
